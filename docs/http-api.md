# HTTP API reference

Everything the server (and gateway) speaks, verified against the code. The
[TypeScript SDK](../sdk/typescript/README.md) wraps all of this; use the raw
API from other languages or shells.

## Base URL and auth

| Listener | Auth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unix socket `/run/sandbox.sock` | none (file mode 0600, root) | what the CLI uses on-host |
| TCP `--listen <ip>:8080` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | per-host API |
| Gateway `--listen <ip>:9090` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | fleet front door; same API |

All request/response bodies are JSON unless noted. Errors are always
`{"error": "message"}` with a 4xx/5xx status. There is no versioning yet.

Notes for browser frontends:

- **No CORS headers are set.** A browser can't call the TCP/gateway API
  cross-origin directly — put your own backend (or a same-origin proxy) in
  front and inject the bearer token there.
- **WebSocket auth**: browsers can't set an `Authorization` header on a
  WebSocket handshake, so upgrade requests (only) may carry the token as
  `?access_token=<token>` instead. Auth and routing failures on `/shell` are
  delivered as **post-handshake close frames** with code `4000 + HTTP status`
  (`4401` bad token, `4404` unknown sandbox, `4500` failed wake, `4502` agent
  unreachable) and the error message as the close reason — browsers surface
  these to the page, unlike a failed handshake (opaque `1006`).
- **Hibernation is transparent.** A sandbox with `"status": "hibernated"` is
  still fully addressable: any exec/files/dir/shell request — or a TCP
  connection to one of its forwarded ports — wakes it automatically (adds
  ~0.05–2 s to that first request). UIs should treat hibernated as "idle",
  not "stopped".

Against a **gateway**, every endpoint below behaves identically, plus fleet
extras — see [gateway differences](#gateway-differences).

## Objects

### Sandbox

```json
{
  "id": "2fdcea66-d551-417a-9877-77c586f0ea91",
  "name": "my devbox",
  "pid": 41823,
  "vm_id": "…",
  "socket_path": "/run/fc-….sock",
  "tap_device": "fc-tap3",
  "guest_ip": "172.16.0.10",
  "host_port": 5200,
  "rootfs_path": "/opt/fc/rootfs/….ext4",
  "status": "running",
  "created_at": "2026-07-02T10:56:51Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-02T11:06:51Z",
  "hibernate_after_sec": 300,
  "vcpus": 4,
  "mem_mib": 4096,
  "base_snapshot_id": "…",
  "host_addr": "100.64.0.7"
}
```

- `name` — free-form display label (set at create or via `/rename`); omitted
  when unnamed. Not unique, not a lookup key.
- `status` — `"running"` or `"hibernated"` (`"stopping"` is a transient
  internal state you normally won't see).
- `expires_at` — omitted when there's no TTL.
- `vcpus`, `mem_mib` — **always present**: the effective resources the
  sandbox runs with. When no override was given at create, the host
  template's defaults are filled in (compare against `GET /info`).
- `hibernate_after_sec`, `base_snapshot_id` — omitted when zero/empty
  (zero = host default).
- `host_addr` — **gateway only**: the owning host's address. Use
  `host_addr:host_port` (not the gateway address) to reach forwarded ports.
- `pid`, `vm_id`, `socket_path`, `tap_device`, `rootfs_path` are host-side
  internals; frontends can ignore them.

`host_port` is the pre-forwarded mapping to the primary guest port **3000** —
reach an in-guest server at `<api-host>:<host_port>`.

### Snapshot

```json
{
  "id": "b72c5f9e-…",
  "name": "deps-installed",
  "source_id": "2fdcea66-…",
  "tap_device": "fc-tap3",
  "guest_ip": "172.16.0.10",
  "mem_path": "…", "state_path": "…", "rootfs_path": "…", "source_rootfs_path": "…",
  "created_at": "2026-07-02T11:00:00Z",
  "golden": true,
  "format": "diff",
  "base_id": "…",
  "vcpus": 4,
  "mem_mib": 4096
}
```

- `name` — free-form display label (set at snapshot time or via `/rename`);
  omitted when unnamed.
- `golden` — the server-managed pristine snapshot that hot creates clone
  from (at most one; omitted when false). You generally want to hide it or
  badge it in a UI — deleting it just makes creates cold-boot until the next
  server restart.
- `format` — `"full"` or `"diff"` (delta against `base_id`); absent = full.
- `vcpus`/`mem_mib` — resources baked into the snapshot (omitted = template
  default); restores and clones run with these.
- The `*_path` fields are host-side internals.

### PortMapping

```json
{"guest_port": 8000, "host_port": 5201}
```

## Host info

### `GET /info`

Template defaults and per-sandbox override limits — what a sandbox gets when
created without `vcpus`/`mem_mib`, and the accepted override bounds. Lets a
UI label resources without guessing.

```json
{
  "default_vcpus": 2,
  "default_mem_mib": 1024,
  "max_vcpus": 16,
  "max_mem_mib": 64312,
  "guest_port": 3000,
  "hot_create": true,
  "hibernate_after_sec": 300,
  "host_id": "testvm-1"
}
```

- `hibernate_after_sec` — the host-wide idle default (0 = off);
  per-sandbox overrides still apply.
- `host_id` — omitted when the host isn't fleet-registered.

Against a **gateway**, `/info` is answered by one live host (fleet hosts
share a template config); `503` when no host is live.

## Sandboxes

### Create — `POST /sandboxes`

Body (optional — empty body is fine):

```json
{"name": "my devbox", "timeout_sec": 600, "hibernate_after_sec": 300, "vcpus": 4, "mem_mib": 4096}
```

- `name` — display label, at most 64 bytes, no control characters;
  ""/omit = unnamed. Change it later via `/rename`.
- `timeout_sec` — auto-destroy TTL in seconds; 0/omit = no expiry.
- `hibernate_after_sec` — idle-hibernation override: >0 custom window,
  `-1` never hibernate, 0/omit = host default.
- `vcpus` / `mem_mib` — per-sandbox resource overrides; 0/omit = the host
  template's defaults. Bounds-checked (400 on negative, more vcpus than host
  cores, mem below 128 MiB or above host RAM).

Returns `201 Sandbox`. Blocks until the sandbox's in-guest agent is healthy,
so the sandbox is usable the moment this returns. Served from a pre-booted
golden snapshot when available (~0.3–0.5 s), cold boot otherwise (~2–3.5 s).
**A `vcpus`/`mem_mib` override always cold-boots** — Firecracker bakes
resources into the golden snapshot, so an override can't be served from it.
Give the request a generous client timeout (the SDK uses 90 s).

### List — `GET /sandboxes` → `200 [Sandbox…]`

Includes both `running` and `hibernated` sandboxes (a hibernated sandbox is
still addressable). Empty list is `[]`, never `null`.

### Get — `GET /sandboxes/{id}` → `200 Sandbox` | `404`

### Destroy — `DELETE /sandboxes/{id}` → `204` | `404`

Graceful in-guest shutdown, then full resource cleanup (VM, tap, IP, ports,
disk). Works on hibernated sandboxes too.

### Reset TTL — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/timeout`

Body: `{"timeout_sec": N}`. Replaces the TTL counting from now; `0` clears it.
Returns `200` with the updated Sandbox. A reaper destroys expired sandboxes
within ~10 s (running **and** hibernated).

### Rename — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/rename`

Body: `{"name": "new name"}`. Sets the display name; `""` clears it. Returns
`200` with the updated Sandbox. Same validation as at create (≤ 64 bytes, no
control characters → `400`).

### Hibernate — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/hibernate`

Freezes a running sandbox to disk immediately (memory snapshot + VM kill);
the same thing the idle reaper does automatically after
`hibernate_after_sec`. Returns `200` with the updated Sandbox
(`"status": "hibernated"`). `409` if it isn't running on this server.

Waking is implicit — there is no `/wake` endpoint. The next agent-bound
request (exec/files/dir/shell) or connection to a forwarded port resumes it
(~50 ms typical, up to ~2 s on the clone path).

## Commands

### Exec — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/exec`

```json
{"cmd": "pnpm install", "cwd": "/home/sandbox/app", "env": {"CI": "true"}, "timeout_sec": 120}
```

- `cmd` runs via `bash -lc`, as root, in the sandbox.
- `cwd` defaults to `/home/sandbox/app`; `env` is appended to the agent's env.
- `timeout_sec` defaults to 60. On timeout the whole process group is killed
  and `timed_out` is true.
- stdout/stderr are each capped at 2 MiB.
- The request returns when the **shell** exits — background children
  (`my-server & sleep 0.5`) keep running inside the sandbox afterwards; their
  output is captured only until shortly after the shell exits.

```json
200 {"stdout": "…", "stderr": "", "exit_code": 0, "timed_out": false, "duration_ms": 288}
```

Note: a non-zero exit code is still HTTP 200 — check `exit_code`.

### Streaming exec — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/exec/stream`

Same request body. Response is **NDJSON** (one JSON object per line, flushed
as produced — not SSE, so read the response body incrementally):

```
{"type":"stdout","data":"installing…\n"}
{"type":"stderr","data":"warning: …\n"}
{"type":"exit","exit_code":0,"duration_ms":41230}
```

Exactly one `exit` event ends the stream. All fields except `type` are
omitted when zero-valued — treat absent fields as `0`/`""`/`false`
(a clean exit may arrive as just `{"type":"exit","duration_ms":12}`).

### Interactive shell — `GET /sandboxes/{id}/shell?cols=120&rows=32&cwd=/home/sandbox`

WebSocket upgrade to a real `bash -l` on a pty. This is a **supported client
API**, not an internal detail. Query params set the initial size (defaults
80×24) and working directory; browser clients append `&access_token=<token>`
(headers can't be set on a WebSocket).

- **Binary frames**: raw terminal bytes, both directions (guest→client is
  stdout+stderr combined; client→guest is stdin).
- **Text frames** (client→server): `{"type":"resize","cols":120,"rows":32}`.
- Clean shell exit closes the socket with close reason `exit:<code>` — parse
  the trailing integer.
- **Errors close with code `4000 + HTTP status`** and the message as the
  close reason: `4401` bad token, `4404` unknown sandbox, `4500` failed
  wake, `4502` agent unreachable. The handshake itself succeeds first, so
  these reach browser `onclose` handlers instead of collapsing into `1006`.
- Client disconnect kills the shell's process group.
- An open shell pins the sandbox running (it won't idle-hibernate or be
  considered idle while connected).

`sandbox shell <id>` in the CLI and `sandbox.pty` in the SDK are ready-made
clients; the protocol pairs naturally with xterm.js in a browser.

## Files

### Read — `GET /sandboxes/{id}/files?path=/abs/path`

`200` with the raw file bytes (`application/octet-stream`, `Content-Length`
set). `400` if `path` is missing or a directory; `404` if missing.

### Write — `PUT /sandboxes/{id}/files?path=/abs/path`

Request body = file content (raw bytes). Creates parent directories,
truncates any existing file (mode 0644).

```json
201 {"path": "/abs/path", "bytes": 123}
```

### List directory — `GET /sandboxes/{id}/dir?path=/abs/path`

`path` defaults to `/home/sandbox/app`.

```json
200 [{"name":"app","size":4096,"mode":"drwxr-xr-x","is_dir":true,"mtime":"2026-07-02T10:00:00Z"}, …]
```

## Ports

### Expose — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/ports`

Body: `{"guest_port": 8000}` (1–65535). Forwards the guest port to a
pool-allocated host port. Idempotent — re-exposing (or exposing the primary
port 3000) returns the existing mapping.

```json
200 {"guest_port": 8000, "host_port": 5201}
```

Works on a hibernated sandbox without waking it — the new port is just
another wake-on-connect entry point.

### List — `GET /sandboxes/{id}/ports`

`200 [PortMapping…]` — all forwarded ports, always including the primary
`3000 → host_port` mapping first.

## Snapshots

A snapshot is a complete capture of a running sandbox: memory, processes, and
disk. See [Concepts](concepts.md#snapshots-restore-and-fan-out) for the
prepare-once/clone-many workflow.

### Take — `POST /sandboxes/{id}/snapshot`

Body (optional): `{"name": "deps-installed"}` — a display label for the
snapshot. Pauses the sandbox (~1 s), writes memory + device state + a frozen
disk copy, resumes it. The source keeps running. Returns `201 Snapshot`.
`409` if the sandbox isn't running on this server (e.g. hibernated).

### Restore (1:1) — `POST /snapshots/{id}/restore`

Body (optional): `{"name": "…", "timeout_sec": N, "hibernate_after_sec": N}`.
Boots a **new** sandbox resuming the snapshot exactly — same processes, same memory.
Reuses the snapshot's baked network identity, so: the source sandbox must be
dead, and at most one restore of a given snapshot can run at a time (`409` on
conflict). Returns `201 Sandbox`.

`vcpus`/`mem_mib` are rejected with `400`: resources are baked into the
snapshot when it is taken — a restored sandbox always runs (and reports)
the source's resources.

### Fan-out (1:N) — `POST /snapshots/{id}/fanout`

Body: `{"count": 32, "timeout_sec": 600, "hibernate_after_sec": N}`
(`count` >= 1 required). Starts N identity-neutral clones concurrently — each
with a fresh IP/ports and copy-on-write disk. Returns `201 [Sandbox…]` with
every clone that came up (**partial success possible** — the array may be
shorter than `count`; failures are logged server-side and their resources
reclaimed). `500` only if every clone failed. `vcpus`/`mem_mib` are rejected
with `400`, same as restore.

### Rename — `POST /snapshots/{id}/rename`

Body: `{"name": "new name"}`. Sets the snapshot's display name; `""` clears
it. Returns `200` with the updated Snapshot.

### List — `GET /snapshots` → `200 [Snapshot…]`
### Delete — `DELETE /snapshots/{id}` → `204` | `404`

Removes the snapshot record, its on-disk artifacts, and (when GCS durability
is on) its bucket objects in the background.

## Gateway differences

The gateway fronts N hosts with the same API, plus:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /info` | Forwarded to one live host (fleet hosts share a template config); `503` when none is live |
| `GET /hosts` | Fleet state: `[{"id","addr","slots_total","slots_used","hibernated","free","alive","last_seen_ms_ago"}]` |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text format: `sandbox_hosts_live`, `sandbox_slots_total/used/free`, `sandbox_create_queue_depth`, per-host gauges |
| `POST /sandboxes` | Bin-packed onto the fullest live host with a free slot. When the fleet is full the request **waits in a bounded queue**; if it can't be placed it fails `503` with `Retry-After: 5` — retry with backoff. `502` if the chosen host errored |
| `GET /sandboxes` | Merged across all hosts |
| `/sandboxes/{id}/…` | Proxied to the owning host (includes exec, exec/stream, files, dir, `/shell`, ports, `/snapshot`, `/hibernate`); unknown id → `404` |
| `host_addr` | Sandbox objects gain `"host_addr"`: the owning host's address. Use `host_addr:host_port` (not the gateway) to reach forwarded ports — the SDK's `getHost()` does this |
| `GET /snapshots` | Merged + deduped across live hosts |
| `POST /snapshots/{id}/restore` / `/fanout`, `DELETE /snapshots/{id}` | Forwarded to the owning host; if that host is dead/unknown, any live host serves it by pulling the snapshot from GCS (returns `503` if no live host) |

## Errors and limits

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | malformed body (`timeout_sec < 0`, `count < 1`, out-of-bounds `vcpus`/`mem_mib`, resource overrides on restore/fanout, missing `path`, bad JSON) |
| 401 | missing/invalid bearer token (TCP/gateway listeners only) |
| 404 | unknown sandbox/snapshot/file |
| 409 | restore conflict (source or a prior restore still running); snapshot/hibernate of a sandbox not running on this server |
| 502 | in-guest agent unreachable; gateway → host proxy failure |
| 503 | gateway only: no live host with capacity (create queue timed out; `Retry-After` set) |
| 500 | provisioning failure (host out of pool slots, VM boot failure, failed wake, …) |

Capacity: each host has fixed pools (default 64 sandboxes: taps, IPs, host
ports 5200–5263). Hibernated sandboxes release their tap/IP slot but **keep
their host ports reserved**. When a host's pool is exhausted, creates fail
with 500 (or queue at the gateway) — size your fleet or TTLs accordingly.
