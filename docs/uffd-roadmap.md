# UFFD roadmap — from a wake trick to a memory substrate

Status: **plan**. Follows the shipped-but-default-off UFFD restore (see
`docs/scale-to-zero.md` and `internal/vm/uffd_linux.go`).

## The lesson from the first cut

We shipped UFFD as a *wake-latency* optimization and measured it on the fleet:
File-backend wake was already ~80 ms warm, UFFD ~110 ms — **File won**, because
the mem file is small + page-cache-warm, so eager load just maps cached pages
while UFFD adds a userspace round-trip per 4 KiB fault. Conclusion: latency is
the **weakest** use of UFFD, and the one case where it loses.

The point of UFFD is not "load the same local file lazily." It's that **the fault
handler can source a page from anywhere** — a remote object store, a compressed
chunk, a peer host, a zero-fill — and can decide *when* to load it. That's a
memory-virtualization substrate, and it's what unlocks the things this project
actually wants: multi-host restore, density, and migration.

## What UFFD uniquely unlocks (that the File backend cannot)

1. **Remote / chunked snapshot memory** — pages served on demand from GCS
   instead of a full local mem file. This is the **multi-host scale-to-zero
   enabler** (Model B in the scale-to-zero doc): wake any sandbox on any host
   without first downloading its whole memory. We already upload snapshots to
   GCS (`snapshot_gcs.go`); this makes the download page-granular and lazy.
2. **Memory overcommit / density** — reclaim idle guest pages (balloon →
   `MADV_DONTNEED`) and fault them back in via UFFD on next touch. This is the
   real "thousands per host" lever (CLAUDE.md's open "no memory overcommit"
   item), far more than wake latency ever was.
3. **Page dedup + CoW across clones** — every clone of the golden shares one
   read-only backing; only dirtied pages/chunks diverge and get re-uploaded.
   Cuts both host RAM and network (the BuildBuddy pattern).
4. **Live/postcopy migration** — resume a sandbox on a target host immediately,
   pull its pages from the source on demand. Fleet rebalancing / draining a host
   without cold restarts.

## Best practices (from Firecracker's own docs + production handlers)

- **The handler must never leave a fault unserved.** If it crashes or hangs mid
  fault, "Firecracker will wait forever" on that page. Our `recover()` keeps
  *serve* alive, but a swallowed fault still hangs that guest — so on an
  unrecoverable fault we must **kill the VM**, not just log. Add connect
  timeouts and a recycle/watchdog. [FC docs]
- **Handle `UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE`, not just PAGEFAULT.** When a balloon reclaims
  memory (`MADV_DONTNEED`), the range stays uffd-monitored and later refaults;
  the handler must **zero** those pages (`UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE`), not re-fetch stale
  file contents. Our loop currently ignores non-fault events — a correctness gap
  the moment ballooning/overcommit exists. [FC docs]
- **Serve zero pages with `UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE`.** Fresh/sparse regions are huge and
  zero; zeropage avoids reading/copying zeros from the file.
- **Fault-ahead.** FC's reference handler loads "the entire region the address
  belongs to" per fault; a tunable prefetch window (N pages around the fault, or
  the enclosing chunk) amortizes the per-fault round-trip that cost us in the
  A/B. This alone likely flips local UFFD to parity/better.
- **Isolate the handler.** Best practice is a **separate, jailed process** (UDS +
  mem file inside the jail, socket accessible only to FC + handler, cgroup
  limits), retrieving FC's pid via `SO_PEERCRED`. We run it in-process for now —
  fine for a trusted single-tenant fleet, but a deviation to revisit for
  multi-tenant. [FC docs]
- **Scale with one epoll loop, not a thread per VM.** Production handlers
  (Aquifer) multiplex every VM's uffd on a single epoll-driven thread. Ours
  blocks one goroutine (+ OS thread) per awake VM — fine at tens, not thousands.
- **Chunk + compress + dedup for remote memory.** Split the mem image into
  fixed chunks keyed by content hash, compress, store in the cache, fetch lazily,
  cache locally for reuse across VMs, and CoW dirty chunks (only re-upload the
  dirtied ones). [BuildBuddy]

## Plan (phased; each independently shippable and measurable)

### Phase A — Make local UFFD competitive (cheap, unblocks the rest)
Fault-ahead prefetch window + record the wake working-set and bulk-prewarm it on
the next wake (one big `UFFDIO_COPY` of exactly the touched pages, around resume).
Re-run the A/B; target UFFD ≤ File locally. This is the groundwork the remote
path reuses. (`UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE` moved to Phase C — its real value is
zero-on-refault under ballooning, not local latency.)

**Fault-ahead: DONE (commit 1a1874b), fleet-measured 2026-07-20.** A fault now
copies a 128 KiB window (`prefetchPages`) in one `UFFDIO_COPY` instead of one
4 KiB page. Warm wake went 109–132 ms → **80–86 ms, parity with File (~81 ms)** —
the per-fault round-trip regression is gone. It's parity, not a win: a small
page-cache-warm guest gives lazy loading nothing to save. Cold first-wake is
still ~520 ms vs File's ~197 ms.

**Working-set prewarm: ATTEMPTED, then PARKED for Phase B (commit 63094b0).**
Built record+persist+prewarm, but hit a design wall that makes naive recording
useless: **snapshotting a UFFD-restored VM faults in the ENTIRE guest memory
through the handler** — `hibernate`'s `PUT /snapshot/create` reads every guest
page to write the new mem file, so a page not already present faults to us. The
recorded "working set" therefore captures the whole guest (from the snapshot
read, not guest execution), and prewarm always trips its >50% skip. Recording
the true startup set needs a **seal-recording-before-snapshot** signal from the
hibernate path into the handler — real design work that belongs with the Phase B
remote source (where prewarm actually pays off and the recorded set is what you
prefetch over the network). Reverted the wiring; kept the two wins below.

Two things this increment DID land and keep:
- **`poll()`-driven fault loop** (commit 3759dcf): a blocking `read()` on the
  uffd does not reliably wake when Firecracker exits, so `serve()` never returned
  and its cleanup (mmap unmap, fd close) leaked one 1 GiB mapping + fd per wake.
  `poll()` sees `POLLHUP` on teardown and exits deterministically. Latent leak
  fixed; also the epoll-style shape the scaling best-practice wants.
- **fault-ahead** stays as above.

Lesson for when Phase B builds working-set properly: (1) stop recording before
the hibernate snapshot (seal signal), and (2) persistence must key off a
deterministic `serve()` exit — the `poll()` fix is the prerequisite.

### Phase B — Remote/chunked page source (the real prize: multi-host)
Introduce a `pageSource` interface behind the handler (the local mmap is one
impl). Add a GCS-chunk impl: chunked+compressed mem in the existing snapshot
bucket, lazy per-chunk fetch on fault, local chunk cache, CoW `.dirty` chunks,
dedup on re-upload. Wire the **clone-path wake** (`wakeClone`) and a new
"wake on any host" path to it. Requires async/pipelined fetch (never block the
fault thread on a bare network RTT) + working-set prewarm (done right this time)
so a cold remote wake doesn't fault-storm over the network.

**Starting point for the fresh session (de-risked ordering — build in this
order, each independently shippable + measurable):**

- **B0 — `pageSource` seam (pure refactor, no behavior change). DONE.** Extracted
  the handler's page fetch into `type pageSource interface { at(off, length
  uint64) ([]byte, error); close() error }` (`internal/vm/uffd_source.go`, kept
  untagged so it compiles + unit-tests on macOS via `x/sys/unix`). Today's mmap
  path is now `localSource` (owns the mmap + file, does the overflow-safe clamp);
  `copyRange` asks `h.src.at(...)` for the bytes, then `UFFDIO_COPY`s
  `buf[0]..len(buf)`. The lifetime contract is documented on the interface: `at`
  returns a slice valid until the copy completes (localSource → a zero-copy
  subslice of the mmap; a remote source → an owned/cached buffer). The handler's
  `mem`/`memFile` fields collapsed to one `src pageSource`; `releaseMem` →
  `releaseSource` (fault-goroutine-owned, still guards the close via `srcOnce`).
  Unit-tested `localSource` (bounds, short-clamp, overflow-safe past-end, zero-copy
  aliasing). Linux cross-compile + darwin `go test ./...` both green. Everything
  below is now additive behind this seam.
- **B1 — chunked local source. DONE.** `chunkedSource` (`uffd_source.go`, still
  untagged) indexes the mem image into fixed chunks, maps a fault to
  (chunk idx, offset-in-chunk), materializes a chunk on first touch via an
  injectable `load(idx)`, caches it (no eviction in B1), and serves the fault as a
  zero-copy subslice **clamped to the chunk end** — a straddling run returns short
  and the tail refaults into the next chunk, which keeps the copy length
  page-aligned (chunkSz is a 4 KiB multiple). `newLocalChunkedSource` wires
  `load` to on-demand `ReadAt`s of the mem file (no whole-file mmap), which is the
  exact shape B2 reuses: only `load` changes (ReadAt → lazy GCS fetch). Selected
  by `uffd_chunk_kib` in the config (0 = today's mmap `localSource`, default),
  threaded config → `server.Config.UFFDChunkBytes` → `RunOptions.UFFDChunkBytes` →
  `startUffdHandler` → source pick. Unit-tested: indexing/boundary-clamp with an
  injected loader + load-count assertion (cache hit), a loader error surfacing as
  an `at()` error (unserved fault the handler must escalate), and a file-backed
  round-trip that reassembles the whole image through faults. Correctness note
  locked in: **UFFDIO_COPY requires dst + len page-aligned but NOT src**, so heap
  chunk buffers are safe — the same fact that lets B2 decompress into a buffer.
  Behavior identical to mmap; default off. darwin `go test ./...` + linux
  cross-build/vet green.
- **B2 — GCS chunk source (same host first). DESIGN WRITTEN — see
  `docs/uffd-b2-design.md` (awaiting review).** At hibernate, upload chunks
  (gzip, content-hash keyed → dedup/CoW; all-zero chunks are a never-stored
  sentinel) to the existing snapshot bucket alongside a positional chunk manifest
  (`hib/<id>/manifest.json`, written last as the commit marker). On wake, only
  `chunkedSource.load` changes: local disk cache → GCS `GetBytes(chunks/<hash>)`
  → decompress, with async chunk-level prefetch to hide the RTT. Ships the
  **kill-VM-on-fetch-failure** gate (an `onFatal` closure that SIGKILLs FC, so an
  unservable fault stops the guest instead of hanging forever) — the prerequisite
  to turning UFFD on anywhere. Codec decided: gzip (reuse `gcsblob`'s codec, zero
  new deps; manifest carries `"codec"` so zstd is a later format-compatible swap
  if p99 gunzip dominates). Proposed sub-order: **B2a** read path + kill-on-fail +
  concurrency-safe cache + prefetch (local manifest, no network); **B2b** hibernate
  upload + GCS fetch + dedup; **B2c** cache-dropped wake **p99** vs File — finally
  where UFFD beats File (File downloads/rebases the whole 1 GiB first). Blast
  radius stays inside `internal/server` + the new source; no `gcsblob` transport
  changes needed (per-chunk objects use existing `PutBytes`/`GetBytes`/`Exists`).
  - **B2a SHIPPED** (read-path machinery + kill-on-fail, no network): `chunkedSource`
    now single-flights `chunk(idx)` (a fault + any prefetches for the same index
    share one in-flight `load()`), does chunk-level async prefetch of the next
    `prefetch` chunks bounded by a semaphore (local sources set `prefetch=0` → no
    goroutines, behaviour identical to B1), and `close()` drains outstanding
    prefetches before releasing the store. Kill-on-fault gate landed: a `fatalOnce`
    on `uffdHandler`, set in `RestoreUFFD` to SIGKILL Firecracker, fires when
    `src.at()` errors — the guest stops cleanly (poll() sees POLLHUP, serve() tears
    down) instead of hanging forever on an unserved page. Unit-tested (race-clean):
    single-flight load-count, prefetch-window warming + close-drain, `fatalOnce`
    once-semantics.
  - **B2b SHIPPED** (hibernate upload + GCS fetch + dedup): new
    `internal/server/uffd_chunks.go`. A **full** hibernation freeze background-uploads
    its mem image as gzip, content-addressed `chunks/<sha256>` (dedup via a process
    known-set + `Exists`; all-zero chunks are a never-stored sentinel) + a positional
    `hib/<id>/manifest.json` written last as the commit marker. A same-identity wake
    with `uffd_chunk_gcs` on builds a `vm.UFFDChunkSource` from the manifest whose
    `Load` = local chunk cache (decompressed, content-addressed, under `SnapshotDir`)
    → GCS `GetBytes` → gunzip → write-through, feeding B2a's prefetch/single-flight/
    kill-on-fault. Falls back to the local mem file when no manifest (diff freezes
    aren't chunked — they hold only dirty pages). Config: `uffd_chunk_gcs`,
    `uffd_chunk_prefetch` (→4), chunk size from `uffd_chunk_kib` (→2 MiB). vm stays
    free of gcsblob: source is injected via `RunOptions.UFFDChunks`; `startUffdHandler`
    now takes a pre-built `pageSource` (`buildUFFDSource` picks GCS/local-chunk/mmap).
    Unit-tested (race-clean): manifest build (geometry, zero sentinel, dedup, short
    tail), gzip round-trip, `newChunkLoad` (cache write-through + warm hit + zero +
    error-propagation + past-end) with a fake fetcher, `roundChunkSize`.
  - **B2c MEASURED on the fleet (2026-07-22).** Deployed the B2 build fleet-wide with
    `uffd_chunk_gcs` on, created a sandbox, forced a full freeze (wake→re-hibernate,
    since hot-clones freeze as diffs), which uploaded **512 chunks / 1 GiB: ~60–93
    unique non-zero (26–50 MiB gzip), ~419 all-zero sentinels**; re-freeze deduped
    15–22 chunks (CoW working). Then woke it from a **cold local chunk cache** so
    every touched chunk was fetched from GCS. Per-fault latency (running histogram):
    `p50 ≤ 2µs, p99 ≤ 65 ms, max ~99 ms`, end-to-end wake **~1.4–2.1 s**. Reading:
    **p50 ≈ 0 = the prefetch + single-flight cache is doing its job** (most faults hit
    an already-materialized chunk); the **p99/max tail is the cold GCS GetBytes +
    gunzip of one 2 MiB chunk** (~65–99 ms each). For comparison, a local-mem UFFD
    wake of the same sandbox was ~0.5 s and same-host File is ~0.2 s (page-cache-warm
    local mem). **So on the SAME host the chunk source is slower — as expected: it
    pays GCS fetches the local backends avoid. Its win is CROSS-HOST (B4)**, where
    File must first download+rebase the whole 1 GiB before resuming while the chunk
    source resumes immediately and streams only the working set. B2 is proven correct
    and lazy end-to-end; the cross-host A/B that shows the actual win is B4. Fleet was
    reverted to the prior release (98a7eaf, UFFD off) + test artifacts cleaned up.
  - **Bug found during B2c, now FIXED + fleet-verified (commit f68733c): `faultLoop`
    did not exit on FC teardown** — the `poll()` POLLHUP exit (commit 3759dcf) does
    NOT fire on this kernel/FC even though FC's process is dead, so the loop hung,
    leaking the fault goroutine + page-source mapping (1 GiB mmap for `localSource`)
    per wake, and the teardown summary never logged. Fix: a **stop eventfd** in
    faultLoop's poll set that `close()` signals on FC process-exit (`cmd.Wait`, which
    IS reliable); `signalStop`/`closeStop` are `stopMu`-guarded against fd-reuse.
    POLLHUP kept as a secondary. Verified on the fleet: teardown summary now fires
    (`serving:1 / exiting:1`, was 0), and a local-mem UFFD wake histogram read
    `faults=9050 p50≤2µs p99≤2µs max=28µs` (confirms local UFFD faults are sub-µs
    page-cache-warm reads). A running summary every 512 faults (27b9cc3) is kept too.
- **B3 — working-set prewarm, done right. SHIPPED (commit 4e9b424); fleet A/B
  pending.** Done chunk-granular (not the parked page bitset — the payoff is the
  GCS chunk source): `chunkedSource` records the chunk indices the guest FAULTS
  in `at()` (NOT the prefetch path — the working set is what the guest touched,
  not what we speculated). The **seal** fixes the Phase A pollution bug:
  `hibernate()` calls `vm.SealUFFDRecording(m)` BEFORE `Pause`+`Snapshot`, so the
  snapshot's whole-guest read doesn't get recorded, and captures
  `vm.UFFDWorkingSet(m)`; the chunk upload persists it to
  `hib/<id>/workingset.json`. On the next chunk wake, `gcsChunkSource` fetches it
  into `UFFDChunkSource.Prewarm` and `newChunkedSource` spawns ≤`prefetch` bounded
  workers that bulk-fetch those chunks in the background as the guest resumes —
  cold fault-storm → warm cache. `recordingSource` is an optional interface
  (localSource no-ops). Unit-tested (record/seal/dedup/prefetch-exclusion +
  background prewarm), both platforms green.
  - **Fleet A/B (2026-07-22): prewarm CONFIRMED to help; tail-collapse needs more
    concurrency (which has an OPEN crash).** Same sandbox, two cold-local-chunk-
    cache wakes (chunk cache `rm`'d between them so prewarm is the only warming):
    baseline (no working set yet) `faults=512 mean=2753µs p99≤65ms max=104ms`, wake
    **1.709s**; WITH prewarm @`prefetch=4` `faults=512 mean=1294µs max=82ms`, wake
    **1.198s** — **~30% faster wake, ~2× lower mean fault latency.** But **p99
    stayed in the ≤65ms bucket**: 4 prewarm workers can't warm the 78-chunk working
    set before the guest faults its tail. The set recorded correctly (78 chunks;
    seal excluded the snapshot fault-in — Phase A bug fixed) and the teardown fix
    held.
  - **`uffd_chunk_prefetch=32` crash — DIAGNOSED + FIXED + fleet-verified (commit
    54a71e2).** Root cause (from `firecracker-<vmid>.log`, which lives in `/tmp`,
    not the task dir): **FC panics on resume** — `available virtio descriptors N >
    queue size: 256` (`devices/mod.rs`) — during its "artificially kick devices"
    step, which reads the virtio rings out of guest memory (UFFD-served).
    Isolation nailed the trigger: `prefetchAhead@32` (post-resume) is fine and
    `prewarm@4` is fine; only `prewarm@32` crashes — so it's high-concurrency
    prewarm fetches racing FC's **resume-time** ring reads, not concurrency per se.
    Fix: `newChunkedSource` no longer launches prewarm in the constructor (which ran
    at/before `LoadSnapshot`); it stores the indices and `RestoreUFFD` calls
    `startPrewarm()` AFTER the load+resume API returns, so prewarm races only the
    guest's own faults (like fault-ahead). **Re-verified on the fleet: prewarm@32
    now wakes cleanly AND collapses the tail — cold-cache p99 65ms → 128µs** (max
    ~79ms from a few un-prewarmed chunks). The concurrency-hygiene fix (unique temp
    per chunk-cache write, 6259fda) also stands. Fleet reverted to 98a7eaf (UFFD
    off); test artifacts cleaned. **Net B3 result: prewarm works, and at adequate
    concurrency (≥~32) it collapses the cold-wake fault tail ~500×.**
- **B4 — cross-host wake. DESIGN WRITTEN — see `docs/uffd-b4-design.md`
  (awaiting review).** The architectural piece: hibernated sandboxes are
  host-pinned today (reconcile skips them; port listeners re-bind on the owner).
  Make the state file + chunk manifest durable in GCS, let a *different* host
  pull the state and serve mem via the GCS source, and extend gateway
  placement/routing to wake off-host. Do this LAST, once B2/B3 prove the source.
  The design closes four durability gaps (device state, rootfs, registry record,
  owner fence — mem is already chunked to GCS from B2), reuses the existing
  clone-path wake (`wakeClone`) + `handleRestore`-shaped reconstruct-from-GCS,
  and keeps the gateway stateless (resolve-on-miss dispatches an internal
  `/adopt` to a live host). Proposed sub-order **B4a** durable record+state+
  rootfs upload → **B4b** host-side adopt+wake + split-brain fence (gateway is
  sole dispatcher + `hib/<id>/owner` epoch + reconcile-relinquish, optionally a
  new `gcsblob` CAS) → **B4c** gateway resolve-on-miss + the cross-host A/B vs
  File (the number that closes the roadmap thesis) → **B4d** GC (stretch).
  Four decisions resolved 2026-07-22 (recorded in the doc): off-host wake covers
  **dead-host recovery AND drain/rebalance**; the **gateway stays GCS-free**;
  **diff freezes are cross-host wakeable too** (far host rebases onto the golden
  base); **add `gcsblob` CAS** for the owner fence.
  - **B4a — durable upload + CAS. SHIPPED (unit-tested; not yet fleet-verified —
    nothing reads it until B4b).** `gcsblob.PutBytesIfGenerationMatch` +
    `GetBytesGen` + `ErrPreconditionFailed` (create-if-absent via gen=0,
    generation-match update; 412 terminal via its own retry loop; base URLs made
    overridable → unit-tested against an httptest fake GCS). Durable record
    upload (`internal/server/hib_durable.go`): a freeze now also ships
    `hib/<id>/state.sz`, `hib/<id>/rootfs.sz` (diff extents vs the golden base
    when base-derived+durable, else full-sparse), `hib/<id>/mem.diff.sz` (diff
    freezes; full-freeze mem still chunks via B2), and `hib/<id>/record.json`
    LAST as the commit marker — for BOTH full and diff freezes (was full-only).
    `uploadHibChunks` refactored to a ctx-taking, error-returning
    `uploadMemChunks` the orchestrator composes. Gated on the existing
    `uffd_chunk_gcs`. Pure record builder + CAS unit-tested; darwin tests + vet +
    linux cross-build green.
  - **B4b — host-side adopt/release + fence. NEXT.** `POST /sandboxes/{id}/adopt`
    (reconstruct-from-GCS → clone-wake, or reconstruct-as-hibernated for a
    drain), `POST /sandboxes/{id}/release`, the owner-fence CAS, and reconcile/
    registration relinquish-on-stale-fence. Then B4c (gateway resolve-on-miss +
    drain + the cross-host A/B vs File).

**Correctness gotchas locked in from Phase A (do not relearn the hard way):**
- FC waits **forever** on an unserved fault → a GCS fetch that fails after
  retries must **kill the VM**, never silently skip. Pair with the existing
  `poll()` loop + `recover()`.
- Never block the single fault thread on a bare network RTT — pipeline fetches,
  multiple in-flight, and lean on B3 prewarm. Measure p99.
- `page_size_kib` is BYTES in FC v1.15 (`pageSizeBytes()` handles it); regions
  matched by aligned addr (no underflow) — all already in `uffd.go`.

**First task on resume: B0** (the `pageSource` refactor) — small, safe, and it's
the seam everything else hangs off.

### Phase C — Density via overcommit (balloon + UFFD)
Wire a virtio-balloon device (FC supports it), handle `UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE`
(zero on refault), and add a reclaim policy that balloons idle guests' cold
pages back to the host, faulting them in on demand. This is the honest path to
overcommit CLAUDE.md calls for — UFFD is only the page-**in** half; balloon is
the reclaim half. Biggest density win, biggest lift.

### Phase D — Hardening & scale
Single epoll fault loop across all VMs; separate jailed handler process;
kill-VM-on-unrecoverable-fault + watchdog; metrics (fault rate, page-in latency,
working-set size, chunk hit/miss).

## Feasibility caveats (be honest up front)

- **Overcommit needs FC's balloon, not UFFD alone.** FC registers the restore
  uffd in MISSING mode; the handler can't reclaim resident pages itself
  (it has no handle on FC's address space). Reclaim = balloon (or privileged
  `process_madvise` into FC's mm — hacky). UFFD only serves the faults reclaim
  creates. Phase C is gated on the balloon device.
- **Remote latency must be hidden.** A per-chunk network RTT on the fault path
  stalls the faulting vCPU. Phase B is only viable with Phase A's prewarm +
  fault-ahead + multiple in-flight fetches. Measure p99 page-in, not just mean.
- **`recover()` isn't enough on its own** — a swallowed fault hangs the guest
  (FC waits forever). Pair it with kill-on-fault-failure (Phase D), which the
  current default-off flag makes non-urgent but is a prerequisite to turning
  UFFD on anywhere.
